# Since Google has shut down the original account: https://code.google.com/archive/p/timthumb/

# I've included the final virgin copy of TimThumb 2.8.14 for posterity here, https://github.com/tvcnet/timthumb/blob/master/timthumb.php

Why?
Because your client is still running version 1.8.0, and you need a virgin copy of the last version until you get a chance to update to something that does not require the timthumb.php script.
